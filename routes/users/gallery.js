//Users should be able to upload/download/view photos.
//The system should be able to generate and display a userâ€™s timeline consisting of top photos from all the people the user follows.
//Practically users can upload as many photos as they like. Efficient management of storage should be a crucial factor while designing this system



// Not in scope AsOfNow
//Adding tags to photos, searching photos on tags, commenting on photos, tagging users to photos, who to follow, suggestions, etc.
//We can store photos in a distributed file storage like HDFS or S3

//We also need to store relationships between users and photos, to know who owns which photo. Another relationship we would need to store is the list of people a user follows. For both of these tables, we can use a wide-column datastore like Cassandra.
